## Perform Release
1. Release `ableron-js`
   1. Make sure, `package.json` â†’ `version` reflects the version to be published
   2. Run `ableron-js-publish` workflow in GitHub Actions to release current main branch (using the version set in `package.json`)
   3. Set version in `package.json` to next version via new commit (do not forget to update `package-lock.json` via `npm install`)
2. Release `ableron-java`
   1. Set release version in `pom.xml` (remove `-SNAPSHOT`)
   2. Update version in `README.md` maven and gradle dependency declaration code snippets
   3. Push code changes  - Release and deploy to Maven Central is performed automatically
   4. Set artifact version in `main` branch to next `-SNAPSHOT` version via new commit
3. Manually create [GitHub Release](https://github.com/ableron/ableron/releases/new)
   1. Set tag name to the version declared in `package.json`, e.g. `v0.0.1`
   2. Set release title to the version declared in `package.json`, e.g. `0.0.1`
   3. Set release notes
